## 🏗️ Data Architecture: Medallion Architecture

The project follows the Medallion Architecture pattern, which consists of three layers to ensure data quality, consistency, and usability.

### Bronze Layer
- **Raw Data Storage**  
- Ingests data directly from CSV files.
- Stores raw, unprocessed data into the SQL Server database.

### Silver Layer
- **Data Cleansing & Standardization**  
- Processes include data validation, normalization, and standardization.
- Prepares data for analytical and business use.

### Gold Layer
- **Business-Ready Data**  
- Data is transformed into fact and dimension tables using a star schema.
- Optimized for reporting, dashboarding, and analytics.
